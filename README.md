Abstract:
The recognition of optical characters is known to be one of the earliest applications of Artiﬁcial Neural Networks, which partially emulate human thinking in the domain of artiﬁcial intelligence.A Simpliﬁed neural approach to recognition of optical or visual characters are portrayed and discussed. The document is expected to serve as a resource for learners and amateur investigators in pattern recognition, neural networking and related disciplines. Handwriting recognition is the ability of a computer or device to take as input handwriting from sources such as printed physical documents, pictures and then interpret these pictures or documents as text. Deep learning enables recognition of text to 80% accuracy.
